# SQL2LINQConvertor
A work in progress project aimed at conversion of SQL queries to LINQ queries

Hi I am Ganesh Kamath. I work for ERachana Technologies.

I have been working on ASP.net applications for the past 7 months. I am still new to SQL and LINQ. I have created a basic SQL to LINQ convertor which I hope to see compete in converting SQL to LINQ as the project progresses.

Between December 19th and December 30th, I has asked permission to work on this SQL To Linq Convertor at work. I want my 2 week old  project to gain more contributors over time in order to help others like me who might be looking for a solution.

As of now the code is written to handle simple Select statements.

I came across several complex SQL Queries with Subqueries and Group by clauses which I aim at implementing some time from now. But for the purpose of early feedback I will be posting my code as it is (by chaning few details in the code). I have explicitly verified from our company regarding posting this code.

If anyone else wishes to contribute here. You are welcome to drop me an email at "ganeshkamath89@gmail.com" or contact me at my LinkedIn ID: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ganeshkamath89
